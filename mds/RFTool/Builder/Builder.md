## How to use
To have a builder work, you need **Power Source**, **Redstone Signal** (using **Lever**), and a configured [**Shape Card**](/RFTool/Builder/ShapeCard).

## Builder Config
### Builder Facing
Each Builder when placed, has 4 side, in front of the builder is **South**, left is **West**, right is **East**, and back is **North**. Its facing is completely difference from Minecraft, so dont use F3 facing to config this.
